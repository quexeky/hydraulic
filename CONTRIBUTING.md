# Contributing
Hey there! Thanks so much for looking to contribute. As mentioned before, this is a small repository, but I (quexeky) try and keep myself active on maintaining it.

## Found a bug?
- First check to make sure that it hasn't already been reported as an [Issue](https://github.com/quexeky/hydraulic/issues)
- If you can't find an Issue addressing the problem, open a new [Issue](https://github.com/quexeky/hydraulic/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a title and a clear description with as much detail as possible with a code sample or test case that demonstrates the bad behaviour

## Want to add a feature?
- Same as with bugs, make sure to check that it's not currently being worked on in another [Issue](https://github.com/quexeky/hydraulic/issues)
- If there's no Issue there, then for large features requests (non-cosmetic), please make an [Issue](https://github.com/quexeky/hydraulic/issues/new/choose) for it
- If you want to add a feature by yourself, you'll have to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository and do that on your own machine

## Submitting a change
- TEST IT - Make sure that it passes all tests and nothing else is broken in some way
- Format all of your code with `cargo clippy`. Any unfixed items must provide a reason in both comments and PR
- By submitting any code, you agree that it may be distributed under the [license](https://github.com/quexeky/hydraulic/blob/main/LICENSE) for this repository
- Update your local repository with the most recent changes from this repo and rebase your branch on top of the latest main branch, ideally squashed into a single commit
- Push your local changes to your forked copy of this repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Include a title which sums up the changes made, a description which gives a few more details, a github issue number (if it exists), and you're off to the races
- There may be some discussion on your PR, and if any changes are needed, I'd love to get your help with it.

Thanks again to anyone who might ever want to help out
